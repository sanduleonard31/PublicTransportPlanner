## Files

Top-level files and folders:

- `index.html` — main page
- `header.html`, `footer.html` — header/footer fragments
- `css/` — styles (layout, responsive, utilities, etc.)
- `js/` — site JavaScript (main, header, footer)
- `assets/` — images and other static assets

## Development notes

- The site is static HTML/CSS/JS—no build step is required.
- Use the files in `css/` and `js/` to modify layout and behaviors.
